        <p class="lead">
            The "OpenTWEMP" is abbreviated as the "Open Total War Engine Modding Platform".
            <br>
            The OpenTWEMP project develops an open-source implementation of classic Total War game engine (M2TW/RTW) and its related modding infrastructure.
            <br>
            The OpenTWEMP is an attempt to create a modern game engine platform which would be well known to both gamers and modders of old TWE games.
            <br>
            The crucial mission of the OpenTWEMP project is <strong>porting</strong> existing game modifications created by the global Total War community.
