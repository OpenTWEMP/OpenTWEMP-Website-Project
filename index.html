            <strong>OpenTWEMP</strong> is abbreviated as "Open Total War Engine Modding Platform".
            <br>
            This project develops an open-source implementation of classic Total War (M2TW/RTW) game engines and its related modding infrastructure.
            <br>
            The OpenTWEMP is created to port existing successful modification projects from legacy Creative Assembly game engine to a modern game platform.
            <br>
            As a founder of the project, I'm going to create a game engine which would be familiar and friendly both gamers and modmakers.
